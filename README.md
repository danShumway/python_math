Python Math: Adder's Garden Adventure
===========

A puzzle game designed to teach early math concepts about addition, subtraction, and order of operation.

Guides to code submission
===========

- Overcomenting is better than undercommenting
  - within reason of course, it's better to assume someone won't understand what's going on.
- Use detailed commits/pull requests: 
  - explain what changes you made and why they were made.
- Don't break anything when you commit.
  - The game should still run when you commit, double check to make sure.
  - 

Other good things to do
=============

- Use the issue tracker.
  - Log bugs.
  - Comment on the issues/features that you're working on.
  - If you are working on something and there isn't an issue for it, create one.
    - this helps us see what's being done
    - keeps us from duplicating work
    - makes a wonderful, busy, pretty looking repository for inclusion on resumes.
  - If you're working on an issue, assign it to yourself
    - That way, if you want to work on something and you're not sure what to do, you can just claim any issue that looks fun and isn't already assigned.
